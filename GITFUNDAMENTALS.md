## Version control system such has:

- GITHUB
- GITLAB
- BITBUCKET
  A version control system is used by developers to:

* Collaborate on a project
* To save your code
* Allow developer to track changes to their code
  **_On this BootCamp we will be using GITHUB_**

  I have learnt to use command lines to create :

  - New directory _mkdir directoryName_
  - New file _touch fileName.txt_
  - move to a new directory **cd**
  - Create a repository on **GITHUB**
  - Add push code on **GITHUB**

```
git add
git commit
git push
git status
```

## My Challenges :diamonds:

**It is a bit _confusing_ to remember all the command lines but i guess with more _practise_, I will be fine**.
